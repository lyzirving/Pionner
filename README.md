# Pionner
***Pionner*** is a lightweight engine built at the purpose to learn Computer Graphics.<br>
It is mainly supported by OpenGL, and written in C++. It's not done yet, and it will be continously developed during my journey in studing GC.<br>
The Engine is my first step to study GC, so i call it Pionner.<br>
If you have any questions about the engine or find some bugs and problems in it, please contanct me, i really appreciate your contribution.
